If there are no characters in the characters folder the only character that will show up in the list is the default character.
Press the "Save" button to save what you've created to the characters folder.
If you want to delete a character you can delete their corresponding file in the characters folder. ex If I wanted to delete my character named "Marth" 
I'd find the file by the same name in the characters folder and delete.
If the program crashes or doesn't work make sure there is a "characters" folder in the same folder as the exe.
In order to use the Ike example file simply drag it into the characters folder and then run the program.
